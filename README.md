# Ai+:  Practical Advanced Pandas

Knowing just enough Pandas can mean the difference between exploring and understanding data from a fundamental.  Knowing how to transform data, use multi-indexes, and customize Pandas' visual aspects in Jupyter Lab gives you the power to approach everyday problems confidently.  In this session, you will build on fundamentals you already know to handle a more comprehensive array of data problems.

This session is for anyone who already has a solid foundation of Pandas fundamentals who wants to extend their knowledge with more advanced features, including aggregation, multi-indexing, designing transformations, and customizing DataFrame output.

> The majority of our session will be in Jupyter notebooks and writing code hands-on.  Please review the [environment setup](./environment.md) ahead of time.
